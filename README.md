# GreyHackTool 🕶️💻 (WIP)

> Not working. Not finished. Still kinda cool.

## 🧐 What is this?

This is supposed to be a tool for **automated hacking** in the game [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/). Right now? It does absolutely nothing. But one day, it will do a lot — like:

- Find targets
- Exploit them
- Get root
- Clean your tracks
- Make you feel like a digital ninja

All **in-game**, of course. Don't try this IRL unless you want to meet the real FBI.

## 🧠 What it *will* do (eventually)

- Scan and fingerprint targets
- Automatically exploit known vulnerabilities
- Handle passwords, users, and IPs like a pro
- Upload payloads and execute them
- Wipe logs like a ghost in the shell

All with the press of a button or the run of a script.

## 🔨 Current status

> 💬 “Works on my machine” — Me, but also my machine is imaginary.

- [x] Ambition
- [ ] Functionality
- [ ] Reasonable README
- [ ] Anything that actually works

## 🙌 Why bother?

Because clicking around is boring. Typing long commands is annoying. Automating it is cool. And building it? Even cooler.

## 🧪 Disclaimer

This tool is for messing around **inside Grey Hack** only. It’s a game. Don’t be dumb.

*Stay tuned. Or don’t. I’ll be building this thing either way.*
